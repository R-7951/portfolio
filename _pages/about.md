Hi, I'm  _Rahul_. I'm 26  years old, from an obscure Place and a software developer, or at least, people think I'm the latter. I've broken things, fixed things, messed with things, gotten on a few workplaces, and have come to one conclusion:  _everything is fragmentary and partially needs to be fettled_.

<br />
Thankfully, that can be fixed - or so I hope, for the good of everyone.

<br />
I solve issues with the aid of developing creating new ones to replace them. i've been doing software for the higher part of the modern century, and feature advanced an obligatory practical view combined with a enormous array of information.  the various things I do are:

-   **Software Developer Backend**  - Curretly working at  [Zebra](https://www.zebra.com/)  as a backend software developer usually with Java, Embedded Linux and Kernels.
-   **Android Frontend Developement**  - Worked at  [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/)  as a Frontend Android developer, but I had to leave abruptly because of pandemic Covid-19

<br />
